# Introduction
The Teko API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Teko's API, or
you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk)).

We have other APIs that are also available.  Every action from our application
is supported by an API which is documented and available for use so that you
may automate any workflows necessary.  This document contains the most commonly
integrated resources.

# Authentication
TBD

# SDKs

Teko offers a Javascript SDK to help interact with
the API.  However, no SDK is required to use the API.

## Javascript SDK

The [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/teko-vn/sdk-js) is maintained 
within Github, and contains the installation and usage instructions.
